# Future tickets

Include availability cut off date on rotas so that we know which form responses to ignore in future. (Possibly just close forms)

Proper scoring of shifts. Negative outcomes. Activation functions etc.

Improve volunteer ranking by switching to the winner-stays-on selection method. Reduces complexity and makes the implementation more flexible. Doesn't impose a significant performance penalty as first thought.

Distinguish between incomplete rotas and invalid rotas after allocation.
