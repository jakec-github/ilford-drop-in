# Project Instructions for Claude Code

We are working on an entirely new v2 of this tool in the `v2/` directory. This directory should be
considered the root of the project. Anything outside it is for reference on the existing behaviour.
Documentation on the project can be found in `v2/docs`.

## Git Workflow

- ALWAYS create a new feature branch for each task (naming: `v2/description`)
- NEVER merge branches to `main` or `v2` - I will merge manually after review
- Make clear, atomic commits with descriptive messages
- If continuing work on an existing branch, use that branch instead of creating a new one

## File Modification Rules

- You can READ all files in the repository for context
- You can ONLY MODIFY files within the `v2/` directory
- The `.claudeignore` file enforces this - respect it

## Work Process

1. Create or switch to the appropriate feature branch
2. Implement the requested changes in the `v2/` directory
3. Commit your changes with clear commit messages
4. Wait for my review before proceeding
5. Address any feedback I provide on the same branch
6. Do NOT merge to main

## Style

- Use British English
